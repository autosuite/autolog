# Changelog

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/teaminkling/autologger/tree/0.1.1) (2020-01-25)

**Fixed bugs:**

- The `HISTORY.md` file no longer contain a duplicated message about being automatically generated.
- Valid existing configuration items for [GitHub Changelog Generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator) are now retained.
- Logic change: Instead of picking the newest Milestone, autolog now picks the oldest one that isn't in tags.
- The `since-tag` configuration item needed to be taken from either the changelog or the tags. Normally, the tags are fine, with one exception: you have just made a tag and a build is being made from that push. The script can't figure out what to leave alone, and doesn't know what to regenerate, resulting in an empty `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Now, in this fix, it will look in the `CHANGELOG.md` file for the tag. If it can't find it, it will instead use the latest version found in there.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/teaminkling/autologger/tree/0.1.0) (2019-11-12)

**Implemented enhancements:**

This is not just a GitHub Actions wrapper around [GitHub Changelog Generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator), but an extension that adds some useful new workflow features!

- autolog does not regenerate the current version - or any past versions - if they have been tagged. You can edit them all you like, just don't modify the header!
