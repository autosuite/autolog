# Software Requirements Document

## User Stories

> What does the user want?

Write here what the user requires from the system. The preferred form is "Given X, when Y, then Z."

## Functional Requirements

> How does the entire software system need to behave to fulfil the user's demands?

1. There is a many-to-many relationship between user stories and functional requirements.
2. Functional requirements have a 1-to-many relationship to acceptance tests.
3. Functional requirements have a 1-to-1 (but not onto) relationship with Epics.

> This page does not include individual bug and feature requests, but note: in Inkling Flow they are derived 1-to-many
> from functional and non-functional requirements.

## Non-Functional Requirements

> What is needed from the operation of the system (rather than the behaviour)?

## Architecture

If sufficiently complicated, provide Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams as needed to understand how the system
works. Don't be too formal: just allow people to understand it.
