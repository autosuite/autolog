# Code of Conduct

**TL;DR**: Be friendly, inclusive, respectful, and mindful of your fellow collaborators.

## Everyone's Responsibilities

As a contributor (commenter, code collaborator, feedback-provider, and so on), you are expected to:

- Maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment.
- Respect all other individuals regardless of different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.

### Inclusivity

This project and community will be a harassment-free experience for every collaborator regardless of age, appearance, disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, race, religion, sexual identity, or sexual orientation.

> This isn't an exhaustive list and can be cited by discretion of maintainers.

### Professionalism

Of course, friendly language may result in acceptable banter between collaborators. So what is acceptable and what isn't?

- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances are unnacceptable.
- Attacks on a person for any reason is unnacceptable.

> This isn't an exhaustive list and can be cited by discretion of maintainers.

## Team Inkling's Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for overseeing the standards of acceptable behaviour within this project. This means we can and will edit, reject, and delete pull requests and issues if we can cite instances of unacceptable behaviour.

> This list of actions is non-exhaustive.

## Scope

If you are representing the project or its community, we expect you to follow by the Code of Conduct. The scope of the Code may also be extended to verifiable public interactions and/or personal interactions if they cannot be resolved internally.

## Enforcement

You can send reports of Code-infringing behaviour directly to staff.

We are obligated to:

- Follow our own Code of Conduct.
- Maintain confidentiality in regards to the reporter.
- Provide a response to the reporter.
- Provide transparency in verdict decision-making.

Verdicts handed out to contributors include (but are not limited to) requests for apology, warnings, organisation-wide temporary bans, and permanent bans.
